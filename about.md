I'm studying CS at the Georgia Institute of Technology. There, I'm taking lots of interesting classes, building software for liquid-fueled rockets, leading software projects for the Google DSC, creating video game AI, and much more! 

I'm also working on a startup, [Notitia](notitiaworks.com): the AI sticky note that captures every insight, automatically relating information over time to create a team-wide knowledge base. This project started in Georgia Tech's Grand Challenges program and has entered Create-X Startup Launch.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, painting and drawing, and playing guitar. In the past, I've gone through AI research, art scholarships, and numerous side projects. Find more below!
