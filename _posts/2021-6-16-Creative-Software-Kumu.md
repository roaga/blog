title: Creative Software - Kumu.io
---

Here's just one piece of creative software I've used over the past year: [kumu.io](https://kumu.io)

My team and I have used it to organize tons of research and insights while working on [Notitia](https://notitiaworks.com) 

Here's an example of tons of research on misinformation and attempted solutions: [Notitia's original systems map](https://embed.kumu.io/d6a2158a5b61f8db29aa879e077981f1)

We're currently using it to analyze our customer discovery interviews.

It's a pain to create anything of value, and also painful to view or find anything of value when you're done, but the process of designing the map brings lots of clarity to your thought. I enjoy how it's a decently creative solution to help others be creative in the face of global challenges.
